This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript.

The Next.js Compiler, written in Rust using SWC, allows Next.js to transform and minify your JavaScript code for production.

Compilation using the Next.js Compiler is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default since Next.js version 12.
